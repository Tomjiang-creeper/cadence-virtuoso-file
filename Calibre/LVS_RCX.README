  Note: 
     1. First refer to the notice messages and status logs in the head of 
	each command file.
     2. Some decks may contain several switches for different checking purpose.
	(for example, the "#DEFINE RC_DECK" switch is to switch the deck to
	 a LVS deck or a RCX deck)
	Be careful to correctly set these switches to ensure you run these decks
        in a correct way.(The detail description for each switch can be seen
	in each command file header)
     3. If you are considering to use calibre XRC with calibre-view, please
        make sure to upgrade your calibre version to be greater than v2004.1_3.
	Otherwise, some extracted information for BJT devices can't correctly
        back annotate to the calibre-view.

Before running LVS (flow for batch mode LVS):

1. netlist your circuit as 'out.cdl' (cdl format)
2. cat lvs.add out.cdl > chip.cdl ;makes the final netlist for LVS checking
