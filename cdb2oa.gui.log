114 cells and 676 cellviews were translated from library 'tsmc18rf' in 7.7s.

Message Summary:

WARNING (CDBOA-511): The prVia <name> cannot be translated because the device  
                     cellview does not exist.
                     
                      Generated 8 times. The prRule definition is incomplete and
                     the prVia device cannot be translated. This, however, does 
                     not stop the translator. If you want to use the device in  
                     your design, ensure that the technology library contains   
                     all information and run the translator again.
